echo "üöÄ To test with real MCP client:"
echo "1. Start the MCP server: swift run SwiftDeveloperMCPServer"
echo "2. Connect with MCP client"
echo "3. Use debug_start with ExampleApp target"
echo "4. Set breakpoints in performanceTest function"
echo "5. Inspect calculator actor state during execution"
